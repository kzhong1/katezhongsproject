Leave behind your worries and frustrations. As the sun rises once again at the dawn, wake up with new hopes, dreams, and determination.
Good night. May the moonlight brighten your dreams and the dark clouds of the night cast a shade over all your concerns.
Pack all of your sadness. It’s time to say goodbye to them. Take a break from all the negativity of life and get yourself a soft, warm bed to sleep on.
Sometimes in life, you just have to wait for the right moment to start again. Just like at night you wait till the sunrise up and light up your way.

The stars and moon arrive just to wish you a good night. Let the light of the moon guide your dreams as you pass the night away.
Goodnight I love you!
