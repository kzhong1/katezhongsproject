# katezhongsproject
Kate Zhong, I will be working alone! 

**The Big Idea:** Health, Meditation, Affirmation App (Name - Sunshine)
The main idea of my project is to create an app or website where you can put down your phone number and receive morning, afternoon, and evening affirmations (or however many affirmation notifications you want to receive in a day & curate it to the types of affirmations you want), in the app I want to create links to youtube cardio/workouts/yoga videos, also you can get meditation guidance 
Say if you were stressed or had anxiety and texted that, you would receive a text back helping you 
If you went to the app there would be a meditation tab, workout tab, and affirmations tab: then you could interact with each
Learning Goal 
My learning goal for this project is to build a bridge between my passions—which is focusing on my physical and mental health & my new passion for coding and computer languages. I want to be able to apply what I learned in this course to a real-world project that I want to continue after this course.  
Implementation Plan: 
I will utilize text scrapping for the affirmations I find online, Zapier which allows you to send automated texts, I also want to see if I can use any existing affirmation apps to pull already curated affirmations for mine! 
Project schedule:
I hope to make major progress by every class meeting time. I want to focus on the affirmation side of it first and integrate the text message feature. There are apps that exist already that have thousands and thousands of curated affirmations so I’d want to figure that out first 
On the workout/health side, my idea is to make workouts easily accessible and for everything to be in one place and for free
Since I want to continue this app project later into my senior year, maybe another later addition would be to integrate some healthy social media aspect to it

Affirmations for everyday

Current Updates:
PHASE 1: 
Text message Part 
Page 1: asking people to subscribe 
You can ask them questions: name, phone number, ask what type of messages they want (self-love, motivation, love, health, etc), ask what time/how many times a day they want an affirmation sent 
Then SUBMIT
Page 2: CUSTOMER DICTIONARY Summary page for the admin user
EXAMPLE: Kate will receive 5 notifications a day about health, self-love, etc 
Lists all the users, who the user is, etc all that data 
WHAT I HAVE SO FAR: 
A list of customer names AND phone numbers, first and last 
Then I created a dictionary with the Name as key and phone number as value
Need a place to store all the affirmations dictionary/messages to be sent to users 
Categorize them (using text scrapping) 
EX: [love: I love myself, Love is everywhere; health: I will take care of my body]
